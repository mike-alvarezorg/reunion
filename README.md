## Ancestry Reports
- [23andMe Composition Ancestry Report](./23andMe/ancestry_composition.pdf) provides a summary of the percentages of DNA for Miguel Alvarez. It will be somewhat different for siblings as they would not have inherited the exact same DNA composition from Mom and Dad.
- [23andMe Composition Spain and Portuguese Report](./23andMe/ancestry_composition52.4_SpainishPortuguese.pdf) takes a deeper dive into the Spain and Portuguese DNA. This report is provided because 52.4% of Miguel's DNA is from Spain or Portuguese.
- [Ancestry timeline](./23andMe/ancestry_timeline.pdf) provides a timeline that shows where the different DNA sources may have been incorporated. 
- [Ancestry inheritence](./23andMe/ancestry_inheritence.pdf) works shows in color the parts inherited from the mother and father. These colors work hand-in-hand with the Ancestry timeline report and the Ancestry chromosome report.

The term "haplogroup" refers to a family of lineages that share a common ancestor and, therefore, a particular set of mutations. We identify your haplogroup by determining which branches of the mtDNA tree correspond to your DNA.

- [Maternal Haplogroup](./23andMe/maternal_haplogroup.pdf) shows the lineage from the mother's DNA. Each generation, females pass down copies of their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to their children. mtDNA is only passed down from the mother to the children. Fathers cannot pass mtDNA to their children. It use  It started in Africa, migrated to Asia, and from there to North and South America. From the componsition report you will see that 37.7% DNA is from Indigenous Americans. This happened in North and South America. 
- [Paternal Haplogroup](./23andMe/paternal_haplogroup.pdf) shows the lineage from the father's DNA. Each generation, males pass copies of their Y chromosomes on to their male children. Mothers and females do not have Y chromosomes.
